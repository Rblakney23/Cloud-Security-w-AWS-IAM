This lab is focused on mastering AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) — the core service for authentication and authorization in AWS.

What You'll Build
- Establish IAM users, groups, and roles to manage identity and access.

- Define least-privilege policies with JSON permission documents.

- Set up MFA enforcement for enhanced account security.

- Enable CloudTrail logging to audit IAM activity and policy usage.

Project Goals
Authenticate and Authorize
- Learn how IAM controls who (users) can do what (permissions) in your AWS environment.

Implement Least-Privilege Access
- Practice writing fine-grained policies that only allow necessary actions — a key cybersecurity best practice.

Audit & Monitor
- Use CloudTrail to track changes to identities and permissions, setting the foundation for secure, compliant access.
